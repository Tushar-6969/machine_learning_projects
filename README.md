# 🤖 ML Projects

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Projects** repository!

This repo contains end-to-end projects demonstrating my applied machine learning skills using various tools and libraries like Python, Flask, EasyOCR, Node.js, and Streamlit. Each project is organized in its own folder and can be run independently.

## 📁 Projects Overview

### 1. 📰 Fake News Detector
- **Stack:** Python, Flask, BERT, Transformers
- **Description:**  
  A web app that uses BERT-based transformer models to classify news articles as *fake* or *real*. The backend is built with Flask, and the model is deployed using Hugging Face’s transformers library.
- **Features:**
  - BERT fine-tuning
  - Text preprocessing
  - Real-time prediction API
- **Location:** [`/fake_news_detector`](./fake_news_detector)

### 2. 📄 Text Extractor (OCR-Based)
- **Stack:** Python, Node.js, Express.js, EJS, EasyOCR, Tesseract
- **Description:**  
  An OCR-powered application that extracts text from images using EasyOCR and Tesseract. The backend is handled with Python or Express (Node.js) and rendered with EJS templates.
- **Features:**
  - Image upload and OCR processing
  - Tesseract + EasyOCR for multilingual support
  - Express.js-based server and UI
- **Location:** [`/text extracter`](./text extracter)

### 3. 📑 Resume Screening App
- **Stack:** Python, Streamlit, scikit-learn, TF-IDF, KNN
- **Description:**  
  A resume classification system that categorizes resumes into predefined job domains using TF-IDF vectorization and a K-Nearest Neighbors model.  
  It also visualizes resume data using pie charts and bar graphs.
- **Features:**
  - Cleans and vectorizes resumes using custom regex-based preprocessing
  - Multi-class classification of resumes (e.g., Data Science, HR, Java Developer)
  - Web app built with Streamlit
  - Exports trained model using Pickle for reuse
- **Location:** [`/resume_screening`](./resume_screening)
